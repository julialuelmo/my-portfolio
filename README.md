# Portfolio Template

This repository contains a customizable portfolio starter built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui** components. Use it as a starting point to present your own story, projects, and experience.

> ðŸ”— Demo placeholder: [https://your-username.github.io/your-portfolio/](https://your-username.github.io/your-portfolio/)

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Update the content inside `src/locales` and the data files in `src/constants` with your own information.
- Replace the placeholder images in `src/assets/images` (or point to your own image paths).
- Update social links, contact details, and SEO metadata in `src/components` and `index.html`.

## Building & deploying

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in `dist/`. You can deploy them to any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, etc.).

If you plan to host on GitHub Pages via a `gh-pages` branch, you can follow your preferred workflow or automate it with a GitHub Action.

## Customization checklist

- [ ] Swap out the placeholder profile picture and project images.
- [ ] Translate or edit the copy in `src/locales` as needed.
- [ ] Review the sitemap, robots.txt, and manifest files in `public/` for your domain.
- [ ] Update the README with your own branding once you take ownership.
